This is an [unofficial](#legal) rust implementation for parsing the [.manifest][manifest] file
format, and downloading containing files.

## About

The format was made by [RiotGames][riot-games] and is used by [RiotClient][riot-client] for
downloading game updates.

Layout of the [.manifest][manifest] file is as follows:
  - [file header (28 bytes)](src/parser/header.rs),
  - [zstd compressed data](src/parser/file.rs#60),
  - digital signature.

Decompressed [zstd][zstd] data is a binary [flatbuffer][flatbuffers] format. This crate uses
[generated code](src/generated/flatbuffer.rs) from a mostly complete schema over at
[this repository][rman-schema].

[rman-schema][rman-schema] repository is only added as a submodule as a way to track which schema
version is used.

## Status

This crate is ready for use as-is and should be able to parse all current and future
[.manifest][manifest] files, barring any changes to the format itself. If the library is unable
to parse any specific file, or if it breaks in the future, feel free to
[contribute](#contributing).

The [semver-major][semver] version of the crate will stay at 0, until functionality and purpose
of all of the fields in the flatbuffer schema is known. Besides that, the crate follows
[cargo's versioning guidelines](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/semver.html).

## Installation

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
rman = "0.1"
```

## Usage

See the [documentation][docs-rs] for examples and information about all of the
exposed API's.

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Seeking help

If you need any help with using the library, or have any questions, feel free to open an issue,
or ask for assistance [on discord][discord].

## Acknowledgements

- @moonshadow565 for the amazing work over at
[rman - set of CLI tools for rito manifest and bundle files][moonshadow565-rman]. Most of the
schema is based upon his work.
- @Morilli for creating [ManifestDownloader][morilli-manifest-downloader], which was my first
exposure to the inner workings of `.manifest` format, and for answering my question on discord.
- @Kurainu for creating [RMAN-Parse][kurainu-rman-parse] on which the early drafts of this project
were based on.
